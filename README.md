## Purpose: 
This tool helps classify pictures of birds. It is built off of research-grade pictures of birds posted on inaturalist.com- a community-sourced website that allows users to record their encounters with different wildlife, share their pictures, and interact with other citizen scientists who are interested learning more about nature, helping identify animals/organisms, and help build a robust animal encounter database for scientists to study and analyze. Read more about their mission [here](https://www.inaturalist.org/). 

I am currently a masters in data sceince student who is interested in classification models and am lucky enough to have parents that live in a gorgeous area filled with a wide variety of different birds. My late grandfather was an birdwatcher in the pacific northwest. I did not learn the craft from him before he passed, but I wanted lean into both my connection to him and my interest in image classification models and decided to create this tool.
